          ABOUT US <br /> I developed a passion for plants way back in my early
          twenties. I grew up in the outskirts of Mexico City, surrounded by
          nature. My family owned a big piece of land which was divided between
          my parents, my brothers, my sister, and me. We each had our own house
          and shared common areas with a pool, a huge garden, and some
          undeveloped land. Eventually, my brothers and I built a greenhouse and
          launched a business selling poinsettias. That's when it all started.

          I left the poinsettia business to my brother and worked some other
          jobs (not plant related). But, once you work with plants, soil,
          flowers, seeds, etc. there's no going back. I felt a yearning and I
          missed the smell of damp soil and watching how a few seeds can turn
          into a beautiful shrub, especially when nurtured with just the right
          amount of water and light! Gardening is truly therapeutic. Iâ€™m sure a
          lot of you will agree with me when I say that plants become part of
          the family, just like pets.

          Eighteen years ago my wife, my two beautiful daughters, and I moved to
          California. We packed up and left Mexico with no specific plan. A true
          improvisation leading to a life project. Mendocino offered excellent
          conditions to go back to the plant business. Soon enough, I was
          experimenting with cacti and succulents and Planet Desert was born.
          Three years later, we moved down South, to beautiful Fallbrook,
          California. Here, the Mediterranean weather is just what our cacti and
          succulents (and we) needed.
